## 🚀 About The Project

Resume Builder is a web application that allows you to create your personal resume by adding different sections, such as Work Experience, Education, and more. Data is stored in a database, so you can update your CV whenever you need to. After you have filled out every section, you can download it as a PDF document to share with your future employers.
This project was created for personal use, but it is available for anyone who finds it useful.
